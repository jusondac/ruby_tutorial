## 📚 Chapters in This Level

| Chapter | Topic | What You'll Learn |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| [09](./09-methods.md) | **Methods** | Create reusable code blocks |
| [10](./10-conditionals.md) | **Conditionals** | Make decisions in your programs |
| [11](./11-loops.md) | **Loops** | Repeat actions efficiently |
| [12](./12-blocks-iterators.md) | **Blocks & Iterators** | Master Ruby's powerful iteration features |
| [13](./13-classes-objects.md) | **Classes & Objects** | Build your own data types |
| [14](./14-inheritance.md) | **Inheritance** | Create class hierarchies |
| [15](./15-modules.md) | **Modules** | Share code between classes |

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this level, you'll be able to:
- ✅ Write organized, reusable code with methods
- ✅ Control program flow with conditionals and loops
- ✅ Use Ruby's powerful block and iterator features
- ✅ Design and implement your own classes
- ✅ Build complex applications using object-oriented principles
- ✅ Organize code with modules and inheritance

## ⏱️ Estimated Time
**Total: 12-18 hours** (1.5-2.5 hours per chapter)

## 🚀 Getting Started
Make sure you've completed the [Beginner Level](../01-beginner/README.md) first, then start with [Chapter 9: Methods](./09-methods.md).

## 📖 Prerequisites
- Completion of Beginner Level (Chapters 1-8)
- Comfort with Ruby basics (variables, data types, simple programs)
- Understanding of Ruby syntax and IRB usage

## 💡 Pro Tips
- Practice each concept with your own examples
- Build small projects combining multiple concepts
- Don't rush - object-oriented thinking takes time to develop
- Join Ruby communities for help and inspiration!
