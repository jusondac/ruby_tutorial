## üöÄ Running the Examples

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ensure Ruby 3.0+ is installed
ruby --version

# Install bundler if needed
gem install bundler
```

### Running Individual Examples

```bash
# Beginner examples
ruby examples/beginner/calculator.rb
ruby examples/beginner/todo_list.rb
ruby examples/beginner/guessing_game.rb

# Intermediate examples  
ruby examples/intermediate/library_system.rb
ruby examples/intermediate/finance_tracker.rb

# Advanced examples
ruby examples/advanced/web_scraper.rb
ruby examples/advanced/log_analyzer.rb

# Master level (may require additional setup)
cd examples/master
bundle install  # Install dependencies
ruby microservice_api.rb
```

### Testing All Examples

Use the provided test script to validate all examples:

```bash
# From the tutorial root directory
ruby test_examples.rb

# With verbose output
ruby test_examples.rb --verbose

# With custom timeout
ruby test_examples.rb --timeout 15
```

## üìö Learning Path

### Recommended Progression

1. **Start with Beginner** - Build confidence with basic concepts
2. **Move to Intermediate** - Learn object-oriented programming
3. **Advance to Advanced** - Master complex features and libraries
4. **Achieve Master Level** - Build professional applications

### Study Approach

For each example:

1. **Read the code** - Understand the structure and logic
2. **Run the program** - See it in action
3. **Modify and experiment** - Change values, add features
4. **Build your own** - Create similar programs from scratch

## üõ† Customization Ideas

### Beginner Enhancements
- **Calculator**: Add more operations (power, square root, percentage)
- **Todo List**: Add due dates, priorities, categories
- **Guessing Game**: Add difficulty levels, high scores, multiplayer

### Intermediate Projects
- **Library System**: Add member management, late fees, reservations
- **Finance Tracker**: Add budgeting, goal tracking, reports, charts

### Advanced Extensions
- **Web Scraper**: Add concurrent scraping, data analysis, caching
- **Log Analyzer**: Add machine learning anomaly detection, alerting

### Master Level Features
- **Microservice**: Add authentication, rate limiting, monitoring
- **Add testing**: Comprehensive test suites with RSpec
- **Add CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Missing Gems**
```bash
# Install missing gems
gem install gem_name

# Or use bundler
bundle install
```

**Permission Errors**
```bash
# Make files executable
chmod +x examples/path/to/file.rb
```

**Ruby Version Issues**
```bash
# Check Ruby version
ruby --version

# Install recommended version (3.0+)
rbenv install 3.1.0
rbenv global 3.1.0
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check the tutorial chapters** - Review relevant concepts
2. **Read error messages** - They often contain helpful information
3. **Use Ruby documentation** - `ri` command or online docs
4. **Experiment in IRB** - Test small code snippets
5. **Ask for help** - Community forums, Discord, or GitHub issues
